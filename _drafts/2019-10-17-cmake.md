Here are several convinient commands I used for cmake.

Instant install with binary files of CMake, which is useful esp. while using clusters.

1. Download and install
{% highlight bash %}
# download using wget
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.15.4/cmake-3.15.4-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
# extract with tar ball
tar xvzf cmake-3.15.4-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
# export the binary folder to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$pwd/cmake-3.15.4-Linux-x86_64/bin
# test
cmake
{% endhighlight %}

2. To be continue (I will post several useful docs about cmake and pybind.)
